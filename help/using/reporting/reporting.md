This section will present you how to access and use reports to measure your journeys' effectiveness.

## Reporting interface {#reporting-interface}

The **[!UICONTROL Edit]** tab allows you to:

* **[!UICONTROL Undo]**: cancels your last action on your dashboard.
* **[!UICONTROL Redo]**: cancels your last **[!UICONTROL Undo]** action on your dashboard.
* **[!UICONTROL Clear all]**: deletes every panel on your dashboard.

The **[!UICONTROL Insert]** table lets you customize your reports by adding graphs and tables to your dashboard:

* **[!UICONTROL New Blank Panel]**: adds a new blank panel to your dashboard.
* **[!UICONTROL New Freeform]**: adds a new freeform table to your dashboard.

## Journey summary template {#ootb-template}

Reports are divided into two categories: an out-of-the-box template and custom reports.
The out-of-the-box template, **[!UICONTROL Journey summary]**, gives you a clear view of the most important tracking data.

Each table is represented by summary numbers and charts. You can change how the details are shown in their respective visualization settings.

 The following KPIs are available at the top of your report:

* **[!UICONTROL Journey - Entered]**: total number of individuals who reached the entry event of the journey.
* **[!UICONTROL Journey - Completion rate]**: total number of individuals who reached the end of the journey (or in case of an individual not matching any condition) compared to the total number of individuals who entered the journey.
* **[!UICONTROL Journey - Current]**: total number of individuals currently in the journey.
* **[!UICONTROL Journey - Failed rate]**: total number of journeys that were not successfully executed compared to the number of run journeys.

* **[!UICONTROL Delivery - Open rate]**: total number of opened messages compared to the number of delivered messages.
* **[!UICONTROL Delivery - Click rate]**: total number of clicks in a delivery compared to the number of delivered messages.
